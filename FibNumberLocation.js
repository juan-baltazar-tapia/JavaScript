// The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...) such that the first two numbers are 1 by definition,
//  and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. Fibonacci numbers often appear in mathematics and nature.

// Computationally, the Fibonacci series is a simple series, but the results grow at an incredibly rapid rate. For example, 
// the 100th Fibonacci number is 354,224,848,179,261,915,075—that's enormous, especially considering that it takes six iterations 
// just to find the first 2-digit Fibonacci number.

// Write a function that calculates and returns the index of the first Fibonacci number that has the number of digits specified 
// by the argument. (The first Fibonacci number has an index of 1.)

// You may assume that the argument is always an integer greater than or equal to 2.
